### **Currency Converter ðŸ’±**  

This is a simple **Currency Converter** application built using **[your technology: Java, Python, JavaScript, etc.]**. It allows users to convert between different currencies in real time using live exchange rates (or predefined rates for offline mode). The application features a user-friendly interface, quick conversions, and support for multiple currencies. Future enhancements may include API-based real-time updates, historical exchange rate tracking, and a more advanced UI. Feel free to explore, enhance, and contribute! ðŸš€
